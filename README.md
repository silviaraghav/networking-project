## Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate key networking principles while building a simple yet functional website. The main focus of this project is on DNS resolution, which allows users to input a domain name and retrieve its associated IP address in real time. This showcases the connection between domain names and IP addresses, which is a fundamental aspect of computer networking.

## Features

- **DNS Resolution**: Enter a domain name (e.g., google.com) and resolve it to its IP address using an online API.
- **Networking Concepts**: Learn about DNS, IP addresses, protocols (HTTP/HTTPS), and more through the project's documentation sections.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: The website resolves domain names dynamically and displays the corresponding IP address or error message.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps to set up and run the website on your local machine or upload it to a server.

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- An internet connection for accessing the DNS API

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and content of the webpage
- **CSS**: Styling to make the website visually appealing
- **JavaScript**: Interactive features for DNS resolution
- **IP-API**: Public API used for domain-to-IP resolution

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
